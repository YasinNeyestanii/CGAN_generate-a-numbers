- Welcome to my Github repository, it's a CGAN model repository
# About repository: 
This repository is about generating images of numbers between zero and nine that you give as labels to the generator model and that image generates that number for you, and the steps are as follows:

- first import libraries
- Data analysis and Graphs
- Data Loader
- Device of Process
- Creat a Generator model & Discriminator model
- Train loop
- Save model weights
- Show output 
  
# About Dataset :
About dataset

Explore the beauty and diversity of Persian handwritten digits with our meticulously crafted dataset. This collection features 150,000 images, with 15,000 images per class, spanning the entire range of Persian digits from 0 to 9. These images have been generated using state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), resulting in stunningly realistic representations of each digit.

Key Features:
- 150,000 images of Persian handwritten digits.
- 15,000 images per class, ensuring balanced representation.
- High-resolution 28x28 pixel images.

This dataset is a valuable resource for training and testing machine learning models, especially those designed for digit recognition and generative tasks. Whether you're a researcher or a hobbyist, this dataset can help you explore the world of Persian script and its unique handwritten characters.
